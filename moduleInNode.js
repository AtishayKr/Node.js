// module => module is just a reusable piece of js code that is present in a file
// modules => To improve reusability of your code nd enhance maintainability as we can segregate our functions, classes and variable
//  in different tiles, and then whenever we need them we can ise them in other files.

// this concept is called module pattern in node.js


// nodejs gives us two ways to implement this export and import
// 1. CommonJS moduling system (older version)  export =>module.exports, import => require
// 2. ES6 module system (newer version) export => export, import => import
// import, export will not work in older version of node.js, 
// to make it work we need to change the extension of the file to .mjs



// package manager/dependency manager/module manager/build sytems 
// => Tools / software that helps us to manage our dependencies
